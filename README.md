# Codingprojects
Here are some of the projects I have completed (Java and Python) as part of coursework for my undergrad degree at Warwick.
Below is a description of what the project is about
Python Assignment 2:  Solved a simple SIR model and examined the solution for one set
                      of parameter values and one initial condition
Python Assignment 3: Wrote a Python code to estimate a numerical solution to an integral using two Monte Carlo methods
                     and solved a Stochastic differential equation by Euler's method
Python Assignment 4: Applied machine learning to a modified version of the original dataset (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140366419318997?via%3Dihub) 
                     and reported the results (graphically, using histograms and scatter plots)
Python Assignment 5: Linear Algebra in Python
Java Project 0: Developed a “fraction calculator” which can perform exact arithmetic operations with rational numbers,
                return the result in fraction form.
Java Project 1: Given an array of circles (centres and radii), this code returns the largest, smallest and average area.
Java Project 2: Given a polynomial with complex coeffiecients (with degree 3 to 5), this code finds the roots of the equation,
                and produces the corresponding (RGB) fractal
